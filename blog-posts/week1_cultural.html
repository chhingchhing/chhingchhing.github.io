								After I took the time to learn with EDA and I have learned more from EDA, I'm really proud of the EDA because this program really useful for basic programmer who need to improve on their skill. EDA can improve people who work closely with it to be high commitment, strong motivation, and they would like to learn that session by their passion. I am also like this as well, although I have some problem with understanding the objective of the each topic, but I am really have high commitment for learning about it. 
							</p>

								What that I cannot forget when I have learned with EDA for the week 1 is that I really enjoy with CSS and HTML because they are the things that I work for everyday. But the thing that I really cannot forget it is that I cannot do the practice as perfect with these technologies, although I am a developer.

								EDA is a nice program that everybody can learn by themselve without teachers to train them. EDA can trains more knowledge to students such as CSS, HTML, concept of Design thingking, Wireframe and other resource that programmer need to understand and know about those technologies. Morever, EDA can lets me to know about how to use some tool for helping in the technology career.
								By the way, I still cannot completed my lessons for each weeks.

								I love to learn with this environment which has the strategy to improve soft skill and technical skill. For soft skill development, it lets me to know about concept of how to learn as pair, how to exchange the knowledge to each other. EDA makes me to aware level of myself, which level of my knowledge, and what should I have to improve more. Since I have started to learn with EDA program, I am really excited although I have some parts which make me misunderstanding. By the way, I really have commitment for continuing to learn with EDA.
