									What that I cannot forget when I have learned with EDA for the week 1 is that I really enjoy with CSS and HTML because they are the things that I work for everyday. But the thing that I really cannot forget it is that I cannot do the practice as perfect with these technologies, although I am a developer.

								After I took the time to learn with EDA and I have learned more from EDA, I'm really proud of the EDA because this program really useful for basic programmer who need to improve on their skill. EDA can improve people who work closely with it to be high commitment, strong motivation, and they would like to learn that session by their passion. I am also like this as well, although I have some problem with understanding the objective of the each topic, but I am really have high commitment for learning about it.
